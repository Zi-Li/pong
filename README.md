# pong
From my FIT2102 assignment. This implements a game of pong.

Disclaimer: as this was for an assignment, some pieces of code were provided and are
therefore not my own work. The parts that are my own are the majority of typescript code in pong.ts 
(the section from line 962-965 was provided), the body of pong.html, and the report pdf.
However, note that as this was my submission for an assignment in university, you may not use this code 
for any academic assignment as that will be a breach of academic integrity.

To build: Use a typescript compiler to build the code. (e.g., you can use npm install typescript, then use tsc)

To run:
1. build the project
1. ensure pong.js (built from pong.ts) is in the dist folder
1. run pong.html (e.g., using a web browser)

Description:
This is a game of pong against a basic AI that just directly heads towards the ball.
It contains an additional powerup feature (called 'rage') where losing points enables 
the use of certain abilities. This was created as part of my FIT2102 assignment, so 
the comments and report are a fair bit more detailed than I would normally write.
